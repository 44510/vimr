Project VimR â€” Vim Refined

About
-----

Project VimR is an attempt to refine the Vim experience.

Goals
-----

The very first goal is to get a naked Vim running using [MacVimFramework](https://github.com/qvacua/macvim). Once we have that, we'll start to add convenience GUI features similar to those present in modern editors for Mac. Let's see how far we get! :)
