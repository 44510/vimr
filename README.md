Project VimR â€” Vim Refined

About
-----

Project VimR is an attempt to refine the Vim experience.

The very first goal is to get a naked Vim running using [MacVimFramework](https://github.com/qvacua/macvim). Once we have that, we'll start to add convenience GUI features similar to those present in modern editors for Mac. Let's see how far we get! :)

How to Build
------------
The build process is (yet) quite cumbersome: In the future I'll try to simplify it.

First, clone the project and the `macvim` submodule. Then, build the `macvim` submodule: Assuming you're in the project root

```
$ cd macvim/src
$ ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-rubyinterp --enable-pythoninterp --enable-perlinterp --enable-cscope
$ make
```

We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to include other open source libraries, eg [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest) and [TBCacao](https://github.com/qvacua/tbcacao). Thus, install CocoaPods and do the following in the project root

```
$ pod install
```

Open the `VimR.xcworkspace` file. Select `File > Workspace Settings...` and change `Derived Data Location` to `Workspace-relative` and set it to `build` (the default value is `DerivedData`).

Issue the following command in the project root

```
$ xcodebuild -workspace VimR.xcworkspace -scheme VimR -configuration Release build
```

From now on, you can build VimR by running the `VimR` scheme (in VimR.xcworkspace).

From time to time, we'll edit some files of `macvim` that are not registered in the `macvim/src/MacVim/MacVim.xcodeproj` file like `macvim/src/MacVim/MMBackend.m`. In this case we have to `make` `macvim` again, ie it does not suffice to recompile `VimR` (or `macvim/src/MacVim/MacVim.xcodeproj`).
