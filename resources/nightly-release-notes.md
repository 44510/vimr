⚠️ This build tries to follow Neovim's [master branch](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commits/master) (and our [master](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/commits/master)) on weekly basis. There are few differences to other releases or snapshot builds:

1. This build is not signed (and therefore also not notarized).
2. This build is probably more unstable than others.
